**Hotel Room Assignment AI**  (n8n + Apaleo)



This project is an **AI-powered hotel room assignment assistant** built in \[n8n](https://n8n.io/).  

It integrates with the **Apaleo API** to automatically assign (or upgrade) hotel rooms based on guest history, reservation details, and room availability.



‚ú® **Features:**

\- Uses Google Gemini AI as a reasoning agent.

\- Checks guest booking history for upgrades.

\- Considers birthdays for complimentary upgrades.

\- Avoids downgrades and ensures only available/clean rooms are assigned.

\- Capacity-aware: avoids upgrading if the upgraded category has fewer than 5 rooms left.

\- Fallback logic: keeps original unit if no valid upgrade is available.
